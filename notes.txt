 


try loading the pickle file with new pandas
convert in to numpy 
save into npy

then load npy and create dataframe with costume column and use old pandas


For table  CustomerScorings:
cardholderID and MOBI_MCC_ID
cardholder ID and Merchant Id (sparce but not unique by defintion)


for table cardholdermccscoring:
it should be values for cardholder id and mobimcc id althought there is chance of an error in this table o



list(set(A)-set(B))
Array(where(condition))
xx,yy = np.where(~np.isnan(data[user_idx])) 
apply smooth labellling !!!!
- create a baseline heuristique model to compare with
                if loss_fct == 'cross_entropy':
- formulate a way to keep cosine distance betweeen user embedding close ( make use of the baseline model discussion)
-check bugs

-Try to compute the average distance for each mcc to make comparision on the predictibility 
- percentage of each score in the table for each mcc
